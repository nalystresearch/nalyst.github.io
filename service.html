										What is data?
									</h2></p>
									<p>In today's interconnected world, data serves as the lifeblood of our digital landscape, shaping decisions, innovations, and understanding. But what exactly is data?</p>
									<p align="justify">At its core, data refers to the raw information and facts that we collect, store, and analyze. It manifests in various forms, ranging from numbers, text, images, to sounds. 
										Data is not merely numbers in a spreadsheet or words in a document; it's the fundamental building block upon which information, knowledge, and insights are constructed.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2><p>Data comes in diverse forms:</p></h2>
									<p>
										1. Structured Data: Organized and easily searchable information often found in databases and spreadsheets.<br>
                                        2. Unstructured Data: Information without a specific predefined model, such as text in emails, social media posts, or multimedia files.<br>
                                        3. Quantitative Data: Numerical data that can be measured and quantified.<br>
                                        4. Qualitative Data: Descriptive or categorical information, often subjective in nature.<br>
									</p>
									<p><h2>The Value of Data</h2></p>
									<p align="justify">The true value of data emerges when it's processed, analyzed, and transformed into insights. It drives decision-making, scientific discoveries, business strategies, 
										and technological advancements. Moreover, the advent of big data has intensified the importance of data, revolutionizing the way we understand and utilize information.</p>

									<h2>The Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>
									<p align="justify">
										Nalyst's inception traces back to a volunteer initiative during a summer search in Demola Group Project & The University of the West of Scotland,
										where two engineers and a psychology student united to explore the potential of automation and AI in shaping the future. 
										This dedicated team committed their time to understanding how technology could streamline tasks and revolutionise human interactions with artificial intelligence.
										Founded on the principles of curiosity and a shared vision for a more automated and AI-assisted future, Nalyst emerged as a passion project. 
										The engineers, driven by their technical expertise, collaborated with the psychology student's insights to comprehend not just the mechanics but also the human implications of future automation.
                                        <br><p></p>
										The volunteer effort wasn't merely a search for a solution but a journey into the possibilities that AI could offer in simplifying tasks and improving people's lives. With a common goal to harness AI's potential, the team laid the foundation for Nalyst's creation.
                                        Through this altruistic venture, Nalyst was born, emphasising the integration of AI into everyday tasks, making it more accessible and user-friendly. The collaboration between engineers and a psychology student brought a holistic understanding of how AI could assist and benefit individuals from various backgrounds.
                                        Nalyst's roots in volunteer work and the combined expertise of its founders set the tone for a future where automation and AI intertwine to redefine task management, foreseeing an era of innovation and streamlined efficiency.
